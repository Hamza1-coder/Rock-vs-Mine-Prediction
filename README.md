# Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction


## Installation:
This project requires python 3.x and the following libraries:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit Learn
- You will also need to have software installed to run and execute ipython Notebook

## Work Flow:
- Above libraries are loaded and read.
- Making data useable with respect to fit our model
- Changing data into sparse matrix
- Concept of Cosine Similarity is used in recommondation (1 - distance)
- Function which perfrom on data and recommond 10 similar movies


## Conclusin:

- take a desire input and give us prediction with 85% accuracy rate (output: Rock / Mine)
